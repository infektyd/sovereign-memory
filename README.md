# Sovereign Memory

Sovereign Memory is a local-first memory spine for AI agents. It gives Codex,
Claude Code, Gemini, OpenClaw, Hermes, and future agents a shared recall daemon,
agent-owned Obsidian vaults, manual vault-first learning, auditable handoffs, and
an opt-in AFM self-organization loop.

It is built for agents first and humans second: the durable source of truth stays
local and inspectable, while the agent surfaces get fast recall, compact context
packs, and continuity across sessions.

## What v4 Adds

- **Storage abstraction**: SQLite remains runtime truth while vector backends can
  fan out through disk FAISS, memory FAISS, and future Qdrant/Lance adapters.
- **Eval harness**: recall quality gates, query fixtures, comparison reports,
  and policy contracts live beside the engine.
- **Retrieval upgrades**: cache layers, query expansion, HyDE cold-query second
  pass, MMR token packing, progressive disclosure, and source authority metadata.
- **Memory governance**: structured learnings, contradiction detection,
  supersession, feedback demotion, trace IDs, health reports, and hygiene checks.
- **Agent continuity**: Claude Code hooks, Codex and Gemini plugin manifests,
  handoff inbox/outbox packets, scar-tissue capture before compaction, and
  deterministic `<sovereign:context>` envelopes.
- **AFM self-organization**: opt-in dry-run compile passes for session
  distillation, synthesis, procedure extraction, vault reorganization, and
  pruning. Drafts are written for review, not silently accepted.

## Core Runtime

The Python engine lives in [engine/](engine/).

- [engine/sovrd.py](engine/sovrd.py) exposes the local JSON-RPC daemon.
- [engine/sovereign_memory.py](engine/sovereign_memory.py) exposes CLI commands for indexing, stats, hygiene,
  vector status, and AFM compile dry-runs.
- [engine/db.py](engine/db.py) owns schema creation and migrations. Migrations are additive and
  tracked by name plus `PRAGMA user_version`.
- [engine/retrieval.py](engine/retrieval.py) combines FTS5, semantic vectors, reranking, feedback, query
  expansion, HyDE, token budgets, and trace capture.
- [engine/afm_passes/](engine/afm_passes/) contains the self-organization passes. They default to dry-run
  and degrade cleanly when AFM is unavailable.

SQLite is the durable runtime truth. Vault pages, graph exports, FAISS files,
and plugin context packs are derived or review surfaces.

## Plugin Surfaces

The shared plugin lives in [plugins/sovereign-memory/](plugins/sovereign-memory/) and ships multiple
agent-facing manifests from one TypeScript MCP server:

- [plugins/sovereign-memory/.codex-plugin/](plugins/sovereign-memory/.codex-plugin/) for Codex.
- [plugins/sovereign-memory/.claude-plugin/](plugins/sovereign-memory/.claude-plugin/) plus
  [plugins/sovereign-memory/hooks/hooks.json](plugins/sovereign-memory/hooks/hooks.json) for Claude Code.
- [plugins/sovereign-memory/.gemini-plugin/](plugins/sovereign-memory/.gemini-plugin/) for Gemini extension usage.
- [plugins/sovereign-memory/.mcp.json](plugins/sovereign-memory/.mcp.json) for direct MCP registration.

The plugin exposes:

- `sovereign_status`
- `sovereign_recall`
- `sovereign_prepare_task`
- `sovereign_prepare_outcome`
- `sovereign_route`
- `sovereign_learning_quality`
- `sovereign_learn`
- `sovereign_vault_write`
- `sovereign_audit_report`
- `sovereign_audit_tail`
- `sovereign_compile_vault`
- `sovereign_negotiate_handoff`
- `sovereign_ping_agent_request`
- `sovereign_ping_agent_inbox`
- `sovereign_ping_agent_decide`
- `sovereign_ping_agent_status`

Automatic behavior is recall-only. Durable learning, vault writes, and AFM draft
acceptance remain explicit human or agent decisions.

Cross-agent information sharing follows the same explicit-decision rule. A model
cannot directly read another agent's private memory. It can create a
vault-backed ping contract for a named recipient agent, and the recipient must
approve or deny that request while online before any answer is synced back to
the requester.

## Quickstart

Install Python dependencies for the engine:

```bash
cd engine
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the daemon:

```bash
cd engine
python3 sovrd.py --socket /tmp/sovrd.sock
```

Inspect health and recall from another terminal:

```bash
cd engine
python3 sovrd_client.py --socket /tmp/sovrd.sock status
python3 sovrd_client.py --socket /tmp/sovrd.sock search "memory handoff"
```

Run AFM compile passes as review-only dry-runs:

```bash
cd engine
SOVEREIGN_AFM_LOOP=on python3 -m sovereign_memory compile --pass session_distillation --dry-run
SOVEREIGN_AFM_LOOP=on python3 -m sovereign_memory compile --pass synthesis --dry-run
```

Build and test the plugin:

```bash
cd plugins/sovereign-memory
npm install
npm test
npm run smoke:hook
```

Start the local console:

```bash
cd plugins/sovereign-memory
npm run console
```

The console binds locally and exposes status, audit, prepare-task, and
prepare-outcome endpoints. It does not expose automatic learning.

## Vault Model

Each agent can have its own Obsidian vault while sharing the same daemon and
database. The vault is the readable memory surface:

```text
vault/
  index.md
  log.md
  logs/
  raw/
  wiki/
  wiki/handoffs/
  inbox/
  outbox/
  schema/
```

Use short, sourced wiki pages with frontmatter for durable knowledge. Raw session
material and private logs should stay local and out of public git unless they are
explicitly sanitized.

## Local-First Hygiene

Sovereign Memory is local-first only when four assumptions actually hold on the
host machine. If any of them break, the marketing claim breaks with it:

1. The macOS user account is the security perimeter (single-user box).
2. FileVault is enabled, so the database and vault are encrypted at rest.
3. The vault directory and `sovereign_memory.db` (with its `-wal`/`-shm`
   sidecars) are **not** under iCloud Drive, Dropbox, Google Drive, or
   OneDrive sync roots. Any of those silently exfiltrate "local" memory.
4. The MCP transport is stdio only. There is no remote JSON-RPC fallback at v1.

To keep Time Machine and Spotlight from snapshotting the same data, mark the
vault and database with the macOS backup-exclude attribute:

```bash
xattr -w com.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem true ~/path/to/sovereign_memory.db
xattr -w com.apple.metadata:com_apple_backup_excludeItem true ~/path/to/codex-vault
```

Substitute the real paths on your machine. Run the same command on the
`-wal` and `-shm` sidecars if you want belt-and-braces coverage.

A sample launchd agent for the daemon lives at
[engine/launchd/com.openclaw.sovrd.plist.example](engine/launchd/com.openclaw.sovrd.plist.example).
It sets `Umask` to octal `077` (decimal `63`), which keeps daemon log files
mode `0600` instead of world-readable `0644` — daemon stderr can contain
learning excerpts.

`make audit` will run `pip-audit -r engine/requirements.txt` once SEC-009
lands; until then, run `pip-audit` manually before cutting a release.

## Verification Gate

Before pushing a release candidate, run:

```bash
cd engine && pytest -q
cd ../plugins/sovereign-memory && npm test
npm run smoke:hook
```

Also run a temp-state live smoke:

- Start [engine/sovrd.py](engine/sovrd.py) on a temporary Unix socket.
- Call plugin helpers for status, recall, compile dry-run, and handoff.
- Verify redaction, traceability, and clean SIGTERM shutdown.
- Run migration safety on a SQLite backup, never directly on the live DB.

The v4 acceptance baseline is `213 passed, 3 skipped` for engine tests and
`32 passed` for plugin tests.
