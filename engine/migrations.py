"""
Sovereign Memory — Schema Migrations Runner.

Reads PRAGMA user_version from SQLite and runs pending numbered SQL scripts
from engine/migrations/*.sql in lexicographic order, in a single transaction.
Bumps user_version only on success.

Design principles:
- Idempotent: safe to call multiple times per process (module-level guard).
- Transactional: all pending migrations run as one atomic transaction.
- Additive only: migration scripts must never DROP tables or columns.
- Graceful: any failure raises, leaving user_version unchanged so the next
  start will retry from the same version.
