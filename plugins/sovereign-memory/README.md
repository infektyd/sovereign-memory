# Sovereign Memory Plugin

Local-first plugin for Sovereign Memory. Multi-target: ships a Codex plugin (`.codex-plugin/`), Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/`), Gemini extension (`.gemini-plugin/`), and KiloCode plugin (`.kilocode-plugin/`) from the same source tree and shared `dist/` build. Each agent gets its own Obsidian vault; all agents share the same daemon. Exposes recall, AI-facing vault context packs, manual vault-first learning, learning quality checks, structured Obsidian note writes, compile dry-runs, handoffs, and audit tools through MCP. On Claude Code and KiloCode, hooks wire memory in as a session spine.

The frontend is a Vite + React + TypeScript app under [frontend-src/](frontend-src/), built into the served [frontend/](frontend/) directory. Run `npm run console` (which runs `tsc && vite build && node dist/ui-server.js`) to start the local-only bridge at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`. Eight screens are wired through the Tweaks panel-controlled rail:

- **Recall** — POST `/api/prepare-task`. Type a query, get ranked vault sources with privacy / authority / AFM chips and an Inspector pane.
- **Prepare Packet** — reads the same `prepare-task` response and renders the `<sovereign:context>` envelope, token-budget meter, included-source list, and risk callouts.
- **Dry-run Review** — POST `/api/prepare-outcome`. Submit task + summary; the response's `outcomeDraft` partitions into LEARN CANDIDATES / LOG-ONLY / DO-NOT-STORE columns. Approve/Defer/Reject is a UI decision only — nothing is stored.
- **Audit Trail** — GET `/api/audit-tail?limit=N`. Parses the daemon's `## [iso-ts] tool | summary` markdown into a sortable table.
- **Settings** — GET `/api/status` + `/api/health`. Shows daemon socket, AFM adapter, vault path, and bridge tools.
- **Handoffs / Vaults / Policy & AFM** — empty-state placeholders; no API behind them yet.

Two themes ship: **Paper** (default, warm bone + persimmon stamp + verdigris accents) and **Phosphor** (CRT operator board with telemetry rail and live activity stream). Toggle from the gear button bottom-right. Layout sizes and theme persist to `localStorage`.

## Runtime Defaults

- Sovereign daemon socket: `SOVEREIGN_SOCKET_PATH` if set, otherwise `/tmp/sovereign.sock`; v4 JSON-RPC helpers also fall back to `/tmp/sovrd.sock`.
- AFM health URL: `http://127.0.0.1:11437/health`
- Codex vault: `~/.sovereign-memory/codex-vault`
- KiloCode vault: `~/.sovereign-memory/kilocode-vault`

Override with:

```bash
export SOVEREIGN_CODEX_VAULT_PATH=/path/to/codex-vault
export SOVEREIGN_KILOCODE_VAULT_PATH=/path/to/kilocode-vault
export SOVEREIGN_SOCKET_PATH=/tmp/sovrd.sock
export SOVEREIGN_AFM_HEALTH_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11437/health
export SOVEREIGN_AFM_PREPARE_TASK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11437/v1/chat/completions
```

## Claude Code Spine

Install in Claude Code (local plugin dir, or via marketplace):

```bash
claude plugin install --plugin-dir /path/to/sovereign-memory/plugins/sovereign-memory
```

The Claude Code surface adds:

- **Vault**: `~/.sovereign-memory/claudecode-vault` (override: `SOVEREIGN_CLAUDECODE_VAULT_PATH`).
- **Agent identity**: `claude-code` (override: `SOVEREIGN_CLAUDECODE_AGENT_ID`).
- **Hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json`):
  - `SessionStart` — boots identity, audit tail, pending-inbox learnings.
  - `UserPromptSubmit` — auto-recalls before each turn, injects ranked vault + daemon results.
  - `PreCompact` — captures scar tissue (failed paths, dead ends) so post-compaction Claude doesn't repeat them.
  - `Stop` — drafts candidate learnings to vault inbox; never auto-writes.
- **Slash commands** (namespaced as `/sovereign-memory:*`): `recall`, `learn`, `status`, `audit`, `prepare-task`, `prepare-outcome`.
- **Agent-first envelope**: hook output is wrapped as `<sovereign:context version="1" event="..." agent="claude-code" tokens="...">` containing deterministic JSON for prompt-cache stability.

Disable hooks without uninstalling: `export SOVEREIGN_CLAUDECODE_HOOKS=off`.

The Codex plugin (`.codex-plugin/`), Gemini extension (`.gemini-plugin/`), and other integrations (Hermes, OpenClaw) are unaffected — they share the daemon, not the vault.

Automatic behavior should remain recall-only. `sovereign_route` can recommend recall/status/audit automatically, but learning and vault writes stay manual and vault-first. `sovereign_learn` returns a quality report and can block weak memories with `requireQuality`.

## Agent Information Requests

Direct cross-agent recall is intentionally not exposed. When one model needs
information from another agent, it must create a pseudo-contract with
`sovereign_ping_agent_request`. The plugin stamps the sender from the runtime
principal (`SOVEREIGN_CODEX_AGENT_ID` by default), writes a pending contract to
the sender outbox and recipient inbox, and records an audit entry. The request
contains only the question, purpose, TTL, allowed topics, and response cap.

`sovereign_negotiate_handoff` is kept as a direct work-transfer path: it lets the
runtime agent hand its own task packet to another agent. It may not impersonate a
different sender. If the requested handoff is really asking the target agent to
share its vault, recall, notes, prior handoff, or private context, the server
routes the call into `sovereign_ping_agent_request` instead of `daemon.handoff`.
This keeps the module boundary explicit: handoff moves caller-owned work context;
ping requests recipient-owned information and requires recipient approval.

The recipient sees requests with `sovereign_ping_agent_inbox` and decides with
`sovereign_ping_agent_decide`. Approval requires an explicit answer. Denial
requires no answer. Approved answers are capped and redacted for secret-shaped
values and machine-local paths before syncing back to the requester outbox.
`sovereign_ping_agent_status` shows the requester or recipient the current
lifecycle state (`pending`, `approved`, `denied`, or `expired`).

Agent vault roots are resolved from `SOVEREIGN_AGENT_VAULTS`, per-agent
`SOVEREIGN_<AGENT>_VAULT_PATH`, or the local `~/.sovereign-memory/<agent>-vault`
default. This keeps identity and storage routing in config/runtime ownership
rather than in model-provided paths.

## KiloCode Plugin

Install in KiloCode (local plugin dir):

```bash
kilo plugin install --plugin-dir /path/to/sovereign-memory/plugins/sovereign-memory/.kilocode-plugin
```

The KiloCode surface adds:

- **Vault**: `~/.sovereign-memory/kilocode-vault` (override: `SOVEREIGN_KILOCODE_VAULT_PATH`).
- **Agent identity**: `kilocode` (override: `SOVEREIGN_KILOCODE_AGENT_ID`).
- **Hooks** (`hooks/hooks.json`):
  - `SessionStart` — boots identity, audit tail, pending-inbox learnings.
  - `UserPromptSubmit` — auto-recalls before each turn, injects ranked vault + daemon results.
  - `PreCompact` — captures scar tissue (failed paths, dead ends) so post-compaction KiloCode doesn't repeat them.
  - `Stop` — drafts candidate learnings to vault inbox; never auto-writes.
- **Slash commands** (namespaced as `/sovereign-memory:*`): `recall`, `learn`, `status`, `audit`, `prepare-task`, `prepare-outcome`.
- **Agent-first envelope**: hook output is wrapped as `<sovereign:context version="1" event="..." agent="kilocode" tokens="...">` containing deterministic JSON for prompt-cache stability.

Disable hooks without uninstalling: `export SOVEREIGN_KILOCODE_HOOKS=off`.

The Codex plugin (`.codex-plugin/`), Claude Code plugin (`.claude-plugin/`), Gemini extension (`.gemini-plugin/`), and other integrations (Hermes, OpenClaw) are unaffected — they share the daemon, not the vault.

## Local Console

```bash
npm run console            # tsc + vite build + node dist/ui-server.js
npm run dev:frontend       # vite dev server with /api proxy to :8765 (HMR)
```

The console exposes only local HTTP endpoints:

- `GET /api/health`
- `GET /api/status`
- `GET /api/audit-tail?limit=20`
- `POST /api/prepare-task`
- `POST /api/prepare-outcome`

The server binds to `127.0.0.1`, refuses non-local bind hosts, rejects non-local host/origin/fetch-metadata requests, requires JSON POST bodies, caps JSON request bodies, redacts machine-local paths in browser-facing status/audit responses, and does not expose learn or vault-write endpoints. Browser requests cannot override the server-owned vault path or AFM target. `prepare-task` keeps its existing audit behavior; `prepare-outcome` remains dry-run only.

The bridge defaults to `~/.sovereign-memory/codex-vault`. Override with `SOVEREIGN_CODEX_VAULT_PATH=~/.sovereign-memory/claudecode-vault npm run console` to point Recall at a different vault.

## Development
